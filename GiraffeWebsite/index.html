    <h1>Ranking Giraffes for my Wife</h1>
    <h2>8. Angolan giraffe</h2>
    <img class="angolan" src="./images/Angolan giraffe.webp">
    <p>The Angolan giraffe is by far my least favorite. It looks like a mock giraffe. As if a some kind of long next
        animal decided to roll around in some dirt to get the same spots as a normal giraffe.
    </p>
    <p>3/10</p>

    <h2>7. Nubian giraffe</h2>
    <img class="nubian"src="./images/Giraffa_camelopardalis_camelopardalis_(Al_Ain_Zoo,_UAE),_crop_&_flip.jpg">
    <p>
        The Nubian giraffe is a little better than the one prior. It looks like
        it actually wants to be a giraffe. It's spots are more defined and look like
        they're a part of it, not like some kind of makeup.
    </p>
    <p>
        5/10
    </p>

    <h2>6. West African giraffe</h2>
    <img class="west-african" src="./images/West_African_giraffe.webp">
    <p>
        Now with the West African giraffe you can easily tell the spots are more 
        rectangular. It has good color and a nice gentle face. It still though,
        looks a little dull.
    </p>
    <p>
        5/10
    </p>

    <h2>5. South African giraffe</h2>
    <img class="south-african" src="./images/1620px-giraffe-madikwe-52230996478jpg.webp">
    <p>
        The South African giraffe is great. I love how rectangular the spots are ,and
        the colors are nice and rich. It's not the best but it's pretty dadgum good.
    </p>
    <p>
        7/10
    </p>

    <h2>4. Kordofan giraffe</h2>
    <img class="kordofan" src="./images/featured-16-9_kordofan-3-topaz.jpg">
    <p>
        Kordofan is amazong looking. It has dark, rich, well-defined spots.
        Along with all that, it's name is pretty fun to say. It kinda sounds like something out of Star Wars.
    </p>
    <p>
        8/10
    </p>

    <h2>3. Luangwa giraffe</h2>
    <img class="luangwa" src="./images/giraffe-803174.webp">
    <p>
        This one is basically on the same scale as the Kordofan.
        It's name is cool and it has spots that kinda flare out like a flower.
    </p>
    <p>
        8/10
    </p>

    <h2>2. Masai giraffe</h2>
    <img class="masai" src="./images/2560px-mannetjes-masaigiraffe-in-de-serengeti2c-tanzania2c-12-januari-2013-a.webp">
    <p>
        The Masai giraffe is fucking fantastic. It looks cool as shit.
        Cool color, cool name, cool ass spots.
    </p>
    <p>
        9/10
    </p>

    <h2>1. Reticulated giraffe</h2>
    <img class="reticulated" src="./images/1522px-dsc03019-30819362404jpg.webp">
    <p>
        This is THE giraffe. No others even come close to comparing to this beauty.
        If there was racism amoung giraffes, this would be the founder of the KKK.
